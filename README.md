### Programme

* Development of a Web application supported by a database: requirements gathering, design, modeling, implementation and documentation.

* General notions of architecture of web applications using client scripting languages (JavaScript) and server (PHP).

* Presentation of the Document Object Model (DOM), use of Ajax framework and APIs for data access.
 
* Design of relational databases using data modeling languages (UML), the SQL language and procedural extensions to SQL.
 
* Identification and maintenance of business rules: on the interface (JavaScript), on the business logic and in the database (triggers); define transactions.
 
* General notions of usability and Web Design.

### Artifacts

It was intended to write [artifacts](https://github.com/pedrofraga/LBAW-FEUP/tree/master/artifacts) every week about the following modules:

* User Requirements Specification

* DataBase Requirements

* Architecture and Prototype Requirements

* Final Product Presentation

### Final Product

The final product specification can be found in artifacts [12](https://github.com/pedrofraga/LBAW-FEUP/blob/master/artifacts/a12_produto_final.pdf) and [13](https://github.com/pedrofraga/LBAW-FEUP/blob/master/artifacts/a13_apresentacao_e_discussao.pdf). Here are some images of the final website:
